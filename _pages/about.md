Hi! I am **Atefeh Mollabagher**, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at
[UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), advised by
[Dr. Parinaz Naghizadeh](https://parinazn.com).
Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the
[University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en).
My research focuses on recommender systems, multi agent reinforcement learning, and opinion dynamics.

## Publications

1. [**The Feedback Loop Between Recommendation Systems and Reactive Users**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07105)  
   **A. Mollabagher**, P. Naghizadeh. *American Control Conference (ACC’25)*, 2025.

2. [**Reactive Users vs. Recommendation Systems: An Adaptive Policy to Manage Opinion Drifts**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13473)

## Ongoing projects

- **Multi-Agent RL for Recommender–User Interaction.** Building a framework where both RS and users are adaptive agents; studying drift, fairness–accuracy trade-offs, and platform interventions.
- **Recommendation–User Feedback Loops.** Modeling closed-loop dynamics and mitigation policies (deterministic + stochastic) with convergence and robustness analysis.

## Teaching

- **TA, ECE 250 – Probability & Random Processes (Fall 2025), UC San Diego.** Led discussions, rubrics, and grading.
- **TA, ECE 153 – Probability & Random Processes for Engineers (Spring 2025).** Led discussions, rubrics, and grading.
